     <h3>About Me</h3>
     <p>Being an aspiring Software Engineering Expert gives the main reason why I decided
     to take programming classes.Also I decided to take them because of the desire to learn to code.

     problems challenging the community at large. Also coding is fun and a hobby to me hence the need to join
     programming classes</p>
