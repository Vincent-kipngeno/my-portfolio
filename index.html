       <h3>About Me</h3>
       <p>Being an aspiring Software Engineering Expert gives the main reason why I decided
       to take programming classes.Also I decided to take them because of the desire to learn to code.
       This is so that I can be able to create software programs to solve most of the challenging real life
       problems challenging the community at large. Also coding is fun and a hobby to me hence the need to join
       programming classes</p>
